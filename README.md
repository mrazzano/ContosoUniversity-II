# ContosoUniversity II

### Summary
This application expands upon the ubiquitous ContosoUniversity sample application distributed by Mircrosoft demonstrating the use of Entity Framework 6 in ASP.Net MVC.  This is the second of several posts that will explore different architectural approaches to building the same application.  

ContosoUniversity II builds upon the original sample application introducing use of the Repository and Unit of Work design patterns.
