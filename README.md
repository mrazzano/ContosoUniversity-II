# ContosoUniversity II

### Summary
This application expands upon the ubiquitous ContosoUniversity sample application distributed by Mircrosoft to demonstrate use of Entity Framework 6 in an ASP.Net MVC 5 web application.  This is the second of several posts that will explore different architectural approaches to building the same application to develop a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. 

ContosoUniversity II builds upon previous posts (ContosoUniversity I) replacing the Generic Repository Pattern with the Repository and Unit of Work Patterns.

**Project Highlights:**
- MVC 5 
- Bootstrap
- Onion Architecture
- Repository and Unit of Work Patterns
- Entity Framework 6 and Fluent API
- Dependency Injection with Unity
- Modular Javascript
- LESS CSS framework
